## Installation

To get started with HashKit, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/kaziimy/hashkit/releases). Download the appropriate file for your operating system, and follow the installation instructions provided in the release notes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaziimy/hashkit.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hashkit
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed HashKit, you can start using it right away. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python hashkit.py --help
```

This command will display all available options and commands. You can specify the hash you want to analyze or crack along with the desired attack mode.

## Attack Modes

HashKit supports various attack modes to cater to different needs:

### Dictionary Attack

This mode uses a predefined list of potential passwords to attempt cracking the hash. It is fast and efficient for common passwords.

### Brute-Force Attack

The brute-force method tries every possible combination of characters until it finds a match. While time-consuming, it guarantees results for short hashes.

### Mask Attack

This attack allows you to specify a pattern for the password. For example, if you know the password is 8 characters long and starts with "A", you can set a mask to optimize the cracking process.

### Rule-Based Attack

This mode applies predefined rules to a wordlist, generating variations of words to improve the chances of cracking the hash.

## Wordlist Management

Managing your wordlists is crucial for effective hash cracking. HashKit allows you to:

- Create new wordlists.
- Edit existing wordlists.
- Import wordlists from various formats.

To manage your wordlists, use the following commands:

```bash
python hashkit.py wordlist --help
```

This will display all options related to wordlist management.

## CLI Interface

HashKit‚Äôs command-line interface is designed for ease of use. You can access all functionalities without needing a graphical interface. Each command has built-in help to guide you.

### Example Commands

- To identify a hash:
  ```bash
  python hashkit.py identify <hash>
  ```

- To crack a hash using a dictionary attack:
  ```bash
  python hashkit.py crack <hash> --mode dictionary --wordlist <path_to_wordlist>
  ```
